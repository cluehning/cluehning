# Hi, I'm Cheyenne 👋

## About Me
Mathematics undergraduate exploring **data visualization**, **neural networks**, and **computational models**.  
Passionate about **Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)**, **Game Theory**, and the beauty of mathematical structures.  
Currently working with **Python** and **C++**.

## Current Projects
I’ve committed, alongside my studies, to vibecoding one project per month. My current work focuses on:
- **Fractals** – Mandelbrot & Julia sets from my seminar *Streifzüge durch die Mathematik*  
- **Game Theory** – Strategic models and simulations  
- **Math Experiments** – Code that connects theory with practice

## Featured
[Mandelbrot Set Visualization](https://github.com/cluehning/Mandelbrot)  
A simple HTML demo and Python scripts created for my seminar presentation. Inspired by the elegance of fractals and **Veritasium’s deep dive into Mandelbrot**.
