# Hi, I'm Cheyenne 👋

## 🚀 About Me
- 🎓 Mathematics undergraduate with a passion for **data visualization**, **neural networks**, and **mathematical modeling**.
- 💡 Interested in **Game Theory**, **Fractals**, and **Computational Mathematics**.
- 🌱 Currently exploring **Python**, **JavaScript**, and interactive web technologies.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here
- **Fractal Visualizations** – Mandelbrot and Julia sets, inspired by my seminar *Streifzüge durch die Mathematik*.
- **Mathematical Experiments** – Code that bridges theory and practice.
- **Game Theory Projects** – Implementations of strategic decision-making models.

## 📌 Featured Project
### [Mandelbrot Set Visualization](https://github.com/cluehning/Mandelbrot)
Created during my first semester as part of a seminar presentation. Includes:
- A simple **HTML demo** to illustrate the relationship between Julia and Mandelbrot sets.
- Python scripts for generating fractals.
- Inspired by the beauty of mathematics and **Veritasium’s deep dive into Mandelbrot**.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
The boundary of the Mandelbrot set has Hausdorff dimension 2, meaning it’s as “big” as a plane, even though it’s infinitely thin and infinitely detailed. 🤯
