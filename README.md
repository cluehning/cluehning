# Hi, I'm Cheyenne 👋

## About Me
Mathematics undergraduate exploring **data visualization**, **neural networks**, and **computational models**.  
Passionate about **Game Theory**, **Fractals**, and the beauty of mathematical structures.  
Currently working with **Python**, **JavaScript**, and interactive web technologies.

## Projects
- **Fractals** – Mandelbrot & Julia sets from my seminar *Streifzüge durch die Mathematik*  
- **Game Theory** – Strategic models and simulations  
- **Math Experiments** – Code that connects theory with practice  

---

## Featured
[Mandelbrot Set Visualization](https://github.com/cluehning/Mandelbrot)  
A simple HTML demo and Python scripts created for my seminar presentation. Inspired by the elegance of fractals and **Veritasium’s deep dive into Mandelbrot**.

### Fun Fact
The Mandelbrot set’s boundary has **Hausdorff dimension 2**—as “big” as a plane, yet infinitely thin and infinitely detailed.
